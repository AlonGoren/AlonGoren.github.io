	      <font size="4">My research focuses on epigenomic
	      mechanisms, and merges basic biology, technological
	      innovations and computational analyses. My major
	      interest is in <b>developmental-epigenomic</b>
	      questions,and includes the explorations of chromatin
	      regulatory networks during mouse embryogenesis. In
	      particular, I am interested in understanding in detail
	      how well<i>in vitro</i> tissue culture model systems represent
	      <i>in vivo</i> states.

	      I am a member of the leadership of the Broad Technology
	      Labs (<a href="http://bit.ly/1oGwxZO">BTL</a>) — the
	      department
	      of  <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/">The Broad
	      Institute of Harvard and MIT</a> for
	      promoting biotechnological innovations. My group’s
	      efforts are focused on establishing and applying high
	      sensitivity and high-throughput techniques for
	      principled studies of genome-wide chromatin
	      organization. The motivation to innovate these
	      methodologies is driven by the complex nature of
	      developmental-epigenomics, such as the minimal number of
	      cells in each embryo, the dynamic cellular fate
	      decisions, and the complex genomic organization of
	      chromatin regulators. Our goal is to leverage these
	      innovations to enable the study of chromatin in
	      uncharted settings.

	      I firmly believe that communicating and disseminating of knowledge is a major component of science, and I am involved in mentoring students, presentations of webinars (e.g. <a href="http://bit.ly/189tG2I">Chromatin/ChIP-seq</a>), outreach programs and workshops (e.g. <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/~agoren/2014-BroadE/BroadE-2014_Epigenomics.pdf">2014-BroadE</a>).
