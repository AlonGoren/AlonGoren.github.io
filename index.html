	      <font size="4">I am a principal investigator at the Broad Technology Labs (<a href="http://bit.ly/1oGwxZO">BTL</a>) - the department of <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/">The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT</a> for promoting biotechnological innovations. My research focuses on epigenomic mechanisms, and merges basic biology, technological innovations and computational analyses. My major interest is in <b>developmental-epigenomic</b> questions - explorations of chromatin regulatory networks during mouse early embryogenesis.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Driven by the complex nature of developmental-epigenomic questions - e.g., the minimal number of cells in each embryo, dynamic cellular fate-decisions, or the organization of chromatin regulators (<a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/crome/home">CRs</a>) - my group is establishing and applying high sensitivity and high-throughput techniques for systematic studies of genome-wide chromatin organization. Our goal is to leverage these innovations to enable my group as well as the broader scientific community to study chromatin in uncharted settings.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I firmly believe that communicating and disseminating of knowledge is a major component of science, and I am involved in mentoring students, presentations of webinars (e.g. <a href="http://bit.ly/189tG2I">Chromatin/ChIP-seq</a>), outreach programs and workshops (e.g. <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/~agoren/2014-BroadE/BroadE-2014_Epigenomics.pdf">2014-BroadE</a>).
